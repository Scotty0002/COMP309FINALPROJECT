# COMP309FinalProject
 
Test.py was provided to me by the lecturer and was not implemented by me.

Train.py was provided as a template file where I wrote the construct_model and train_model functions only.

The challenge in this project was finding a proper set of layers for the convolutionial neural network that provides a consistent model for identifying the difference between cherries tomatoes and strawberries.
Experimenting with different parameters was the mjaority of work in this project along with dealing with overfitting of the model on the training set.
